Hello! My name is Conner Gleason, and this is my personal github account for projects, demos and learning alongside other developers! I am an attentive and curious developer always seeking new tools and skills necessary to seperate myself from the crowd, am always prepared to attack problems with tencity and ingenuity, and always in the the spirit of cooperation and inclusivity. Here you can view many of the projects I have worked on over the years and see the associated demos for these projects, as well as the aggregation of many of the learning tools I have used in my time as a Software Developer.

If you find my work interesting or would like to start a conversation with me please feel free to do so using the contact links below! I love collaboration and insight from others in the field and am always excited at the prospect of learning from experience! 😊
